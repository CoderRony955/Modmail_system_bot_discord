# Discord ModMail Bot
**This bot is designed to streamline communication between server members and server staff on Discord. When a member sends a direct message (DM) to the ModMail bot, their query is forwarded to the server staff. This ensures that all messages are managed in a structured manner and staff can respond efficiently.**

## Key Features
- Server-Specific: The bot operates within a single server. Each server will have its own instance of the bot, allowing for tailored interactions and responses.
- DM Forwarding: Messages sent to the bot via DM are forwarded to designated server staff members.
- Structured Communication: Ensures that server staff can easily manage and track inquiries from server members.
- Easy Setup: Simple installation and configuration process for getting the bot up and running in your server.
